Main contributors
*****************

The first Python/PyQt6 release of the GUI was developed by
**Dorian MENDES** (Student at *Institut d'Optique* from 2023 to 2026) during an internship in July 2024.

A second release, which notably made the processing more fluid, was improved by
**Abdallah MRABTI** (Student at *Institut d'Optique* from 2023 to 2026) during a 3-weeks project in 2025.

These two releases were made under the supervision of **Julien VILLEMEJANE** (Teacher at *Institut d'Optique*).



This GUI is based on an obsolete *MatLab version*, developed in the 90's by Lionel JACUBOWIEZ (and students).
The main processes were adapted from this version.

Technical support was regularly provided by
Thierry AVIGNON (Lead Technical and Operations Engineer at *LEnsE* / *Institut d'Optique*),
assistance with physical aspects was given by
Gaëlle LUCAS-LECLIN (Professor at Institut d'Optique) and
David HOLLEVILLE (*Observatoire de Paris*),
and several tests were carried out by Sébastien DE ROSSI (Professor at *Institut d'Optique*).
